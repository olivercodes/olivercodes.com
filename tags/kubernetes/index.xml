&lt;p>When designing a brand new mouse, would you write the drivers or the firmware first? You would design the mouse! How many buttons does it have?
What sort of shape will it be? Who is the intended audience? What colors will we offer? Is it customizable? Is it heavy or light? All of these details factor in to the
user interface of the mouse, and how it will be used by the customer. The underlying details of the mouse, are developed after the initial interface
and design phase.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
