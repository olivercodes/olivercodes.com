&lt;p>[Book] Designing Cloud Native Delivery Systems - ER Copy&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are you grappling with the complexities of software delivery in todayâ€™s distributed environments? As technologies evolve, so do the challenges associated with deploying and managing systems that are robust, scalable, and efficient. Yet, without a structured understanding of the architectural patterns that underpin these systems, making informed decisions can be overwhelming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Terraform is just the firmware of the cloud</title><link>https://olivercodes.com/posts/firmware_of_the_cloud/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://olivercodes.com/posts/firmware_of_the_cloud/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="stop-starting-with-iac">Stop starting with IaC&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>When designing a brand new mouse, would you write the drivers or the firmware first? You would design the mouse! How many buttons does it have?
What sort of shape will it be? Who is the intended audience? What colors will we offer? Is it customizable? Is it heavy or light? All of these details factor in to the
user interface of the mouse, and how it will be used by the customer. The underlying details of the mouse, are developed after the initial interface
and design phase.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Simple Terraform Gitops Workflow, w/ Prow and GH Actions</title><link>https://olivercodes.com/posts/tfgitops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://olivercodes.com/posts/tfgitops/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-simple-gitops-workflow-for-terraform">A simple Gitops workflow for terraform&lt;/h2>
