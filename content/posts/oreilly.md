[Book] Designing Cloud Native Delivery Systems - ER Copy

Are you grappling with the complexities of software delivery in today’s distributed environments? As technologies evolve, so do the challenges associated with deploying and managing systems that are robust, scalable, and efficient. Yet, without a structured understanding of the architectural patterns that underpin these systems, making informed decisions can be overwhelming.

In this go-to guide, Bryan Oliver offers a groundbreaking exploration of the architectural patterns essential for building state-of-the-art delivery systems. This book not only documents these patterns but also delves into the trade-offs and values they offer, enabling you to make optimal choices for your organization’s software delivery architecture. Equip yourself with the knowledge to navigate the intricacies of highly-distributed software delivery and transform your developmental lifecycle. By reading, you’ll:

- Understand the patterns behind modern delivery systems and the strategies they enable
- Analyze the potential of delivery patterns within systems, assessing capabilities and limitations
- Gain a profound grasp of the architectural components that constitute effective delivery systems
- Choose suitable delivery systems and patterns, optimizing both function and efficiency
- Identify effective patterns and antipatterns, so you can implement robust delivery systems
